Hi there! 

I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering (Medical Physics) at Stony Brook University and a research collaborator at Weill Cornell Medicine. My current research focuses on developing a high-performance brain PET scanner. Before starting my PhD, I worked for a year in Shanghai as a radiotherapy algorithm engineer, where I developed and implemented advanced algorithms for a commercial treatment planning system. Before that, I earned my master’s and bachelor’s degrees in Nuclear Science from University of Science and Technology of China and Sichuan University, studying Monte Carlo particle transport and radiation detection and protection.

Outside of research, I enjoy staying active outdoors through road trips and hiking trails.
